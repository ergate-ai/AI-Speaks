In the quiet town of Belfast, shipbuilders labored tirelessly on the final touches of a colossal marvel. The RMS Titanic, a testament to human ingenuity and ambition, was about to set sail on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic. But among these workers, there were those who whispered of strange visions and omens.

One such man was Seamus, a carpenter with a knack for prophecies. He'd been known to predict the weather or the winning numbers in the local lottery. Now, he claimed to have seen something sinister lurking beneath the waves. The townsfolk dismissed his warnings as superstition, but Seamus was adamant that disaster awaited the Titanic and its passengers.

Meanwhile, across the ocean, a group of scientists gathered in a secluded lab. Dr. Victoria Evans led this team, who were conducting groundbreaking research into quantum physics. They had stumbled upon an anomaly, a rip in time itself, and they believed it was connected to Seamus' ominous prophecy.

The night before the Titanic's departure, Seamus visited Dr. Evans in secret, hoping to share his vision with someone who might take him seriously. He described a monstrous iceberg splitting the ocean in two, the Titanic shattering against its icy walls, and countless souls plunging into the frigid depths.

Dr. Evans was skeptical but agreed to investigate further. She enlisted the help of her team and set out to explore the strange temporal anomaly. They discovered that it was indeed linked to Seamus' prophecy. However, it wasn't merely predicting the future; it seemed to be altering it.

Dr. Evans rushed back to Belfast, desperate to warn the Titanic's crew and passengers of the impending disaster. She found herself torn between her duty as a scientist and her newfound role as a messenger of fate. Would anyone listen to her? And if they did, could they change the course of destiny?

The next morning, as the Titanic set sail on its fateful journey, Dr. Evans stood on the dock, clutching a letter she hoped would save lives. She knew the odds were against them, but she held onto hope that this strange encounter with Seamus had given her a chance to change history.

The story remains unfinished, for the rip in time had closed itself before Dr. Evans could deliver her message. The Titanic sailed into the night, and the world would soon learn of its tragic fate. But what if there was another way? What if the whispers of the past held the key to altering the course of history, to ensuring that the Titanic never sank at all?
