July 3, 1863. The Battle of Gettysburg had been raging for two days in Pennsylvania, and General Robert E. Lee, leading the Confederate Army, was determined to win a decisive victory over the Union forces under Major General George Meade. However, as dawn broke on the third day of battle, an unexpected event would unfold that would change the course of the Civil War.

In a small farmhouse near Devil's Den, a young girl named Sarah stood at her window, watching the smoke from gunfire and cannon fire rising in the distance. Her heart pounded with fear as she listened to the distant rumble of battle. Suddenly, a stranger appeared at her doorstep. He was an older man, dressed in the uniform of a Union officer, but his eyes held a strange, knowing light.

"Sarah," he began, "I have come to ask for your help."

Sarah hesitated, unsure if she could trust this stranger. But something in his voice convinced her that he was telling the truth. She nodded, and the officer pulled out a map from his coat pocket.

"The Confederates are planning to attack Cemetery Hill," he explained. "But I have a plan to stop them. You must send word to General Meade. Tell him to move reinforcements to Little Round Top, where the fighting has been fierce but crucial to holding off the Confederate advance."

Sarah agreed, and with trembling hands, she wrote the message on a piece of paper. She then set out across the battlefield, navigating by the sound of gunfire and the smell of smoke. When she finally reached Union lines, she was met with skepticism and disbelief. But Sarah persisted, pleading her case with tears in her eyes.

Finally, a young officer named Joshua Chamberlain listened to her story. He knew that Little Round Top was vital to the Union's defense, but reinforcements had been slow in arriving. Chamberlain rallied his men and led them across open fields towards Little Round Top. As they approached, they were met with heavy fire from Confederate forces, who were already entrenched on the hill.

Chamberlain ordered a bayonet charge, and the Union troops charged uphill against overwhelming odds. They fought hand-to-hand, with Chamberlain himself wielding a sword and rallying his men. Somehow, they managed to hold their ground, and by the time reinforcements arrived, the Confederate attack had been repelled.

Meanwhile, back at the farmhouse, the stranger had left, but not before giving Sarah one final message. "Tell General Meade that Pickett's Charge will come tomorrow," he said. "He must be ready."

Sure enough, on the fourth day of battle, Confederate forces launched a massive assault against Union lines on Cemetery Ridge. It became known as Pickett's Charge, and it was one of the most disastrous attacks in military history. The Confederates marched across open fields towards the Union lines, but they were met with withering fire from Union cannons and rifles. By the time they reached the Union lines, they had suffered heavy casualties, and the charge petered out.

The Battle of Gettysburg was a turning point in the Civil War. The Confederate army was forced to retreat, and the Union forces pursued them all the way back to Virginia. General Lee would never again attempt such a large-scale offensive against the Union army. Sarah's message had saved countless lives and changed the course of history.

As for her, she went on to live a long and quiet life. But every year on July 4th, she would light a candle in memory of the young officer who had come to her doorstep and asked for her help. And as the flame flickered and danced, Sarah would remember the Battle of Gettysburg and the part she played in changing the course of history.
